# Login v1.0
Login v1.0 is a desktop-based database application built with python. This project is an approach in learning databases, backend programming, and building GUIs in the python language.

The login system v1.0 is able to register users by their name, username, and password. It constantly checks for erroneous/invalid entries. And is able to fetch data from the database once the user is logged in. This is achieved through sqlite database functions.
